## Living with a Mouse
In a quite moment in my flat it all started. I'm living alone but a week ago I heard some rattling noises in my kitching. Food plastic packaging rattling against another. I knew something must be there as this was the first time I've ever heard something like this. It was something else than a package falling over and it's done.
I sneaked into the kitching and saw a mouse jumping out of one of my shelves on the floor, splashing white dust around it and rushing under my fridge.
It was to be to be a roach. I was quite sure it was a mouse. I was relieved. I'm intrigued by roaches but mice are okay. I even had a couple of mice as a child.
This week in Summer was super hot, one of the hottest. At work I was exhausted and too busy to fix this mouse issue. I half heartedly built some diy mousetraps from the web with no luck. As it was so warm and I wanted to mouse to better not eat secretly some stuff of my shelve I put down a bottle cap of water and some pumkin seeds. 
It doesn't mattered how much seeds I've put down they were all gone each morning and the water was well sipped. 
There was no mess or bad smell so we got along the week quite well I thought.
After telling a few friends they find it disturbing and even told me some more horrorish stories of mice on their moms face in her sleep. I always wanted to catch it but I never had proper time. On friday however, I bought a mouse trap which will catch it alive. I've put it up friday evening and in the morning I lying in bed I could observe with my ears how the mouse went in and it locked it in. I was filled with joy and jumped out of my bed and brought the mouse to a park and walked quite a while to make sure it will not come back. There I set it free.
Back in my flat I fell on the coach with relief, closing my eyes and appreciate this mouse tasks falling of me which was on my mind all week long. 
No joke at all, I heard that rattling of food packaging again.

## Slow Scrambled Eggs
One of the recent guests on the Tim Ferriss Show was someone who I deeply admire, Adam Savage. Most of the insights Tim gained from Adam I already knew about him. However, his obsession for eggs was new for me. He talked about how he perfected his slow scrambled eggs after a initial receipe from Gordan Ramsay. It facinated me so much, that I till now halted the episode and went on a journey to make this slow scrambled eggs. Attached is the video I discovered of Gordon showing how a masterchef cooks scrambled eggs to die for. And it's true. In less than 24 hours I consumed a 11 eggs in three different tries to recreate them. Even though I butchered the receipe, I had no butter no Creme Fraiche and no Schnittlauch. I just followed the technique of slow heating the egg while continously steering and seasoning it afterwards made these scrambled eggs the most delicous of my live till now.

## Investing in Index Fonds
Till making quite a bit of money sitting in my bank account I always had the urge to invest it somehow. I kind of burned my hands for now in the crypto markets and was sure I don't want to invest more money into it yet.
Out of a coincidence I started listening to the audiobook "Money Master the Game" by Tony Robbins which I had a long time sitting on my wishlist and in my audible collection. Beeing german a few chapters of this book feel a bit unncessary to read because it's focused on americans retirement plans. However, in this book he is repeatedly stating the fundamentals of compond interest. Surely this wasn't new to me but this time it sparked me to take action. In hindsight it's easy to say way. The hidden barrier for me how to even buy stocks and what etfs are dropped. I forced my self into buying stocks at my local bank and after seeing how easy it is and what it costs me, I had a new tool!
It's not like I exactly knew how the stock market and index funds worked. The book doesn't really teach you that, it just motivated me to educate myself and showed me a direction I could go.
So I found this german investment channel on youtube called "Talerbox Invest Smart" which seems to have the same approach to investment as described in Tony's book. With this channel and basic google research I learned what an ETF is, how they differ, what makes a good ETF, how much should I invest in each ETF, when to buy, when to sell. There is a lot to learn and having made some mistakes in crypto world helped me to understand strategies better and most importantly to be less emotional during bear markets.

## Neti Pot

Never had this problem in my live before. My nose was dry but for an annoying long time. I finally started noticing and wanted to fix it. 
I haven't google anything and just though I needed one of these nasal douches to wet things up. I always was curious to try one. After some research I found out there was just one super ugly plastic go to version on the german market. Further research finally discovered a Neti Pots. A tool used in the yoga practice to clean up the nasal tract. Basically it is a clay nasal douche. I didn't want to order one from amazon and decided to visit a one of my favorite local yoga shops. I bought minimalistic white one along with some salt. It basically was just salt you would cook with. I was a bit confused, I thought one would use a more special salt for a nasal douche, but no. I guess you can if you'd like, its more expensive and might be more effective. I never tried it though.
To the experience itself. It fixed my dry nose right away. I used a couple of days a week, problem was fixed. Not using it as often anymore. Also I the experience became less pleasent, not sure why.

## Hammerspoon
I'm a mac user for almost a decade now and before that used Windows on my private machine and Linux (RHEL) on my work computers. However after selling my first macbook pro (I don't really know the reason anymore), I did not direclty buy the newer model, I had an extraordinary affaire with Linux notebook and a Windows gaming rig. Although I made a terrible notebook choice (more on that in another story), I had an almost enlightining moment with Linux on it. Back than my brother was not a mac user and wasn't into gaming either so linux was his operating system all the way. There is many more to that but he showed me the beauty of window management systems. In perticular `q-tile`. I guess most people familiar with linux use Gnome or KDE as a windowmangement system as I did before, because most distributions ship with it. Another group might be familiar with tiling window managers like i3 or xmonad. Anyways it's not important which tiling window manager I ended up with using, it's more the fact that it just blew my mind. I seen it on screenshots before but actually how usable and efficient it is once you memorized all the keystrokes you often define yourself is enlightining. Dragging windows which occlude one another did not make sense anymore, it seemed so stupid. `q-tile` was perfect for me as you configure it in python, additionally to the window managment system it had also had a mindblowing feature for me back than. Beeing able to start programs with a keyboard shortcut. For example ALT + C to open my calender, ALT + E to open my editor, ALT + Return open a terminal. It's like having super powers, while others take ages to still click a symbol in the dock or using spotlight. 
To conclude this, I switched back to mac as my lenovo laptop broke down, my gaming rig had nothing todo anymore and I needed a laptop badly for univeristy. I did miss this elegant way of using my desktop environemnt from my linux days for years. I stumbled upon several third party apps which do just one of these things I mentioned and it's just another system tray icon and bulky programm running. I never was happy with these solutions. And then I finally stumbled upon `Hammerspoon`, it's a magnificiant tool. It feels like you can do everything you could ever imaging with it to control your make, so I brought the best parts of my linux experience back to life with it.

Strava changed my live. Can't exactly say when I started using it but it had a great impact on my health. 
Starting out with tracking my runs, I know excessivley track my bike rides with cadence and heart rate monitors. Having a place to share my rides and plan routes is super essential for me. Surely I wouldn't be as active without Strava.

## Blinkist - 05.06.2019
Since day one I was disgusted by the idea of blinkist. If you don't know what blinkist is, it's a service which summarizes books for you, so you can read it as a ~10 minute digest. I did not want it to work as would make all my previous reading efforts not obsolete but less worthy. Also it feels like it degrades the value of book. Is it really compressable into 10 minutes?
A good month ago a friend of mine told me about a friend of ours who started uses blinkist in order to fullfill his 50 books a year goal. 50 actual books a year is insane, at least for me. I'm happy when I'm ready one book a month. Anyways, it was enough of a shocker to give blinkist my actual first try. I skipped the "free premium period" as I don't want lock my self in into any kind of convenience and only start a subscription if i really wanted to. I was positively suprised that you could actually use blinkist for free. The `downside` of the free tier is that you can only read one book (they name it blinks) a day and this book is chosen by blinkist. As of now I'm using the free tier for over a month now and read 17 blinks. I read digests of books I might not have picked up. There were definitly some books I haven't had on my radar. So far I read blinks of:

Wise Guy- Guy Kawasaki
Hit Refresh - Satya Nadella
The Truth about Employee Engagement - Patrick Lencioni
The Path Made Clear - Oprah Winfrey

And some decent german book blinks as well. It doesn't felt like I only get the leftovers as a free user or how they call it `basic member`.
So the `downside` of a one random book a day feels more like a benefit to be as I can escape my book wishlist and dive into other domains I might not have picked up. Moreover I don't commit hours before realizing this topic is not of interest to me by reading just digests.
Feels like reading a meater and more sophisticated Medium Article a day. I will definitly continue using it.
Sure I still don't think a blink can fully comprehend many books, however now I see it more of an abstract of a book. So I still will continue reading books and if a blinkist book really catches me I can still go out and read the actual book.

## Rebuilding a Bike
Since my second or third grade I travel everywhere by bike. Commuting to school, to parties or shopping in my home town. Even when after graduating and leaving for another city for university I always rode my bicyles everywhere. Day and night, during rain and sunshine, even in the coldest winters.
You don't need to know much to maintain your bike, basically only how to fix a flat tire and of course clean it up every now and then.
Three to four years ago things started to change. My flatmate sold me a great vintage road bike he rebuilt. Not from the ground up but he did some quick wins. Like cleaning it up, changing the tires, fixing the shifting and put on some new bar tape. Additionally he gave it a new matt black paint job. And voila it's a super stylish vintage bike. Unfortunately it was so stylish it got stolen in front of our house in bright day light a couple of weeks after I bought it.
It was my first road bike and I was addicted to it's low rolling resistance, it finally felt like the bike can convert my effort into speed.*
*(Back in the days I used to ride old holland bikes without gears, which where just super comofrtable to sit but felt like a big container ship compared to a super light weight olympian rowing boat.)
So I was curious of getting a new one quickly. I bought a shittier one in the Berliner neighbourhood, it was painted black by hand. It looked quite low quality with this cheap paint job but I thought this will not make i
