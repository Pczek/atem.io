My nose was dry but for an annoying long time. I finally started noticing and wanted to fix it.\nI haven't google anything and just though I needed one of these nasal douches to wet things up. I always was curious to try one. After some research I found out there was just one super ugly plastic go to version on the german market. Further research finally discovered Neti Pots. A tool used in the yoga practice to clean up the nasal tract. Basically it is a clay nasal douche. I didn't want to order one from amazon and decided to visit a one of my favorite local yoga shops. I bought minimalistic white one along with some salt. It basically was just salt you would cook with. I was a bit confused, I thought one would use a more special salt for a nasal douche, but no. I guess you can if you'd like, its more expensive and might be more effective. I never tried.\nTo the experience itself. It fixed my dry nose right away. I used a couple of days a week, problem was fixed. Not using it as often anymore. Also I the experience became less pleasent, not sure why.")))}r.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
